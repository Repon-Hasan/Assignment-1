                <p id="p1"> The 2024 Bangladesh quota reform movement was a series of anti-government[d] and pro-democracy[e] protests in Bangladesh, spearheaded primarily by university students. Initially focused on restructuring quota-based systems for government job recruitment, the movement expanded against what many perceived as an authoritarian government when they carried out the July massacre of protestors and civilians, most of whom were students.[f] Started as a student movement, the movement later escalated into a fully-fledged mass uprising known as the Student–People's uprising.</p>
